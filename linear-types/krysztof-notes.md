One change from the original paper is that we no longer automatically eta-expand.

Philip Wadler has a few papers about linearity:

I recommend 'A taste of linear logic'

Shulman, Linear logic for constructive mathematics https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07518
It's a really interesting look at the linear logic. The later parts are
more heavy mathematics, but the introduction is very readable.
