Maintenance -> more expensinve part of software

Reduce it and reduce software costs

boring domain =/= boring software

E.g. complex code (not boring) for a blog post (boring)

To achieve boring software first:

- Think about requirements & goals
- Define the architecture
- Are goals exhaustive enough

**Project**

- Schema migration CLI
- Up / Down
- All Postgres featatures
- Lang agnostic

**Solution**

That points into us SQL as the DSL

1 SQL file for up. 1 SQL file for down.

Index file: list of migrations.

Config file.
